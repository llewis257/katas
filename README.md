# coding_katas

Codewars is a platform that helps one learn, train, and improve their coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.\
In this repository I post the challenges solved on the platform.\
The instructions of the challenges are either in the file or saved as a README in the challenge's directory.
