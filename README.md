## What is a Kata?

Over the last years a training form from martial arts invaded software development: Katas.

The idea is that you take a combination of moves (or a simple programming problem) and do it over and over again until you can do it in your sleep. With Programming katas you delete your code after the kata.

You can, and I did use this for learning new languages, honing your IDE skills or explore various ways of solving a given problem.

## How were katas done/found?

Codewars is a platform that helps one learn, train, and improve their coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.

In this repository I post the challenges solved on the codewars platform to keep a track on personal improvement.

The instructions of the challenges are either in the file or saved as a README in the challenge's directory.
